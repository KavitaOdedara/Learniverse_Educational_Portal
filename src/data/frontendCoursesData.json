            "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the foundation of all web pages. It is a standard system for creating and structuring web content. HTML allows you to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links on your webpage.",
            "The basic structure of an HTML document includes the declaration <!DOCTYPE html> at the beginning, followed by the <html> tag, which wraps the entire document. Inside the <html> tag, the <head> section contains meta-information like the title and links to external CSS files. The <body> section contains the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, and videos.",
            "Learning the semantic structure of HTML is essential for organizing content effectively. Tags like <header>, <footer>, <section>, and <article> help with this organization, improving accessibility and making it easier for search engines to index your content."

            "HTML tags are used to define elements on a webpage. Each tag serves a specific purpose, such as <h1> to <h6> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <a> for hyperlinks, and <img> for images. HTML tags are the building blocks of web pages, and knowing when and how to use them is crucial for effective web design.",
            "In addition to tags, HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about an element, such as its behavior or its properties. For example, the <a> tag can have an 'href' attribute to specify a link's destination, and the <img> tag can have 'src' and 'alt' attributes to define an image's source and provide alternative text for accessibility."

            "Tables are essential for displaying data in rows and columns. The <table> tag is used to define the table, <tr> defines table rows, <th> defines table headers, and <td> defines table data cells. By learning how to use these elements, you can organize and present data clearly, ensuring it’s easy for users to understand."

            "Attributes like ‘type’, ‘placeholder’, ‘required’, and ‘value’ define the behavior of inputs. For example, <input type=\"text\"> creates a text field, while <textarea> allows multiline text input. Form validation ensures the user provides necessary data before submission."

            "Modern websites often include multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio. HTML provides specific tags for embedding and controlling media. The <img> tag displays images, and the <video> tag allows for embedding video content with controls like play, pause, and volume.",
            "Similarly, the <audio> tag is used for embedding sound clips. To create responsive images that adapt to different screen sizes, the <picture> element is used to display images based on conditions like screen width. These multimedia elements enhance the user experience, making your website more interactive and engaging."

            "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation of HTML elements. With CSS, you can define styles such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, and layout properties that make web pages visually appealing.",
            "There are three ways to apply CSS: inline styles, internal styles, and external styles. Inline styles are applied directly within HTML tags using the 'style' attribute, internal styles are placed inside <style> tags in the document’s <head> section, and external styles are linked to the HTML document through an external CSS file using the <link> tag.",
            "External stylesheets are preferred for larger websites because they separate the structure (HTML) from the style (CSS), making the code more maintainable."

            "CSS selectors are used to target specific elements on a webpage in order to apply styles to them. A basic selector can target an element by its tag name, class, or ID. For example, 'p' selects all paragraph elements, '.class' selects elements with a specific class, and '#id' selects elements with a specific ID.",
            "More advanced CSS selectors include pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. Pseudo-classes allow you to style elements based on their state (e.g., :hover when the user hovers over an element), while pseudo-elements allow you to style parts of an element (e.g., ::before to add content before an element).",
            "CSS combinators define the relationship between elements. For example, the descendant combinator ('div p') selects all <p> elements inside a <div>, and the child combinator ('div > p') selects only direct child <p> elements of a <div>."

            "The CSS box model explains how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of the content area (where the text or images reside), padding (space inside the element), border (edges surrounding the element), and margin (space outside the element).",
            "These four components affect the size and position of elements and their layout on the page. By mastering the box model, you can control element spacing, alignment, and overflow behavior. You can also avoid layout issues by using tools like the browser's developer tools to inspect and modify the box model."

The main properties to control the flex layout include flex-direction (determines the axis of alignment, e.g., row or column), justify-content (aligns items horizontally, e.g., space-between, center), and align-items (aligns items vertically, e.g., center, stretch).",
